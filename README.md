## Welcome to Mauro Bernardi's profile! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  1. variational methods for fast high dimensional Bayesian model selection with [Luca Maestrini](https://sites.google.com/view/lucamaestrini) and [Giulia Livieri](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/giulia-livieri)
  2. fast MCMC methods for Bayesian model selection with Emanuela Cattelan and Claudio Busatto
  3. convex clustering for functional data analysis with [Marco Stefanucci](https://marcostefanucci.github.io/) and [Tony Canale](https://tonycanale.github.io/)
  4. developer and mantainer on CRAN of the R Package [fdaSP](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdaSP/index.html)
